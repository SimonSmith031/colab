# Pipeline CPU in ISE

CPU Core is implemented with self-written verilog files, while others are provided by the tutor. Because configurations are not listed(and I'm even so lazy that I won't fix it), it's nearly impossible to clone the entire repo and build the project. But I'm sure the verilog files do work.

42 kinds of `MIPS` instructions are supported. Details can be found in `def.v` file.
